# What the *\$%* is "Spirituality"?!

This is some sample text that I am typing in here that is eventually going to be filled with links and will look pretty just like Chris' text. Though I don't expect I'll ever be able to get a picture in there but you never know. Does this thing have spellcheck?

How do I embed a link? Is it like this? <https://bookdown.org/chris/naturehacks4life/> or[Is it like this?](https://bookdown.org/chris/naturehacks4life/)

Hah I think I just did it -- remember to use "visual something or other" as interface.
